# Mini Energy Efficiency Tracker

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a simple web application that enables users to input and monitor the energy efficiency of a building. This initiative is designed to showcase the developer's proficiency in Java technologies, agile methodologies, and a solid understanding of application development principles.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Utilize Java 11/17 alongside Spring Boot for crafting RESTful services that serve as the backbone of the application.
- **Frontend**: Employ Angular for the frontend development to demonstrate modern UI development capabilities.
- **Database**: Integrate an embedded database such as H2 for ease of development and testing, with the flexibility to switch to Oracle or Postgres in a real-world deployment scenario.
- **Version Control**: Adopt GIT for source code management, ensuring efficient collaboration and version tracking.
- **Build Tool**: Maven will be used for building the application and managing dependencies, streamlining the development process.
- **Additional Libraries**: Hibernate will be utilized for ORM to facilitate database interactions, although its usage may be minimal due to the project's scale.

## Features

### User Registration and Login
Implement simple authentication mechanisms to showcase backend development skills and security awareness.

### Energy Data Input
Provide a form for users to input building information, such as location, size, and energy usage, to collect data essential for energy efficiency tracking.

### Energy Efficiency Dashboard
Develop a dashboard using Angular charts or graphs to display basic analytics, including average energy consumption, offering insights into energy efficiency.

### Multilingual Support
Incorporate basic internationalization (i18n) support for English and French to address the multinational aspect of the application, enhancing its accessibility and user experience.

## Conclusion

This project aims to highlight the developer's ability to deliver a functional, efficient, and user-friendly application using a modern technical stack and development methodologies. Through the Mini Energy Efficiency Tracker, users will gain valuable insights into the energy efficiency of buildings, contributing to more sustainable living practices.
